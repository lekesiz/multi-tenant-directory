## Critical Efficiency Issues

### 1. Duplicate WHERE Clause in Companies API (High Impact)
**File:** `src/app/api/companies/route.ts`  
**Lines:** 27-97 and 100-122  
**Severity:** Critical  
**Impact:** Performance, Maintainability

**Issue:**
The GET endpoint executes two separate database queries with identical WHERE clauses - one for fetching companies and one for counting total records. The WHERE clause logic is duplicated across ~40 lines of code.

```typescript
// First query (lines 27-97)
const companies = await prisma.company.findMany({
  where: {
    isActive: true,
    content: { some: { domainId: getDomainId(tenant), isVisible: true } },
    ...(search && { OR: [...] }),
    ...(category && { categories: { has: category } }),
  },
  // ... select and orderBy
});

// Second query (lines 100-122) - DUPLICATE WHERE CLAUSE
const total = await prisma.company.count({
  where: {
    isActive: true,
    content: { some: { domainId: getDomainId(tenant), isVisible: true } },
    ...(search && { OR: [...] }),
    ...(category && { categories: { has: category } }),
  },
});
```

**Problems:**
1. Code duplication makes maintenance error-prone
2. If WHERE logic changes, must update in two places
3. Risk of inconsistency between queries
4. Harder to test and validate

**Recommended Fix:**
Extract WHERE clause into a reusable variable to ensure consistency and reduce duplication.

**Estimated Impact:** Medium performance improvement, High maintainability improvement

### 2. N+1 Query Pattern in Newsletter Digest Cron Job
**File:** `src/app/api/cron/newsletter-digest/route.ts`  
**Lines:** 206-266  
**Severity:** Critical  
**Impact:** Performance, Scalability

**Issue:**
The newsletter digest job creates individual database writes for each email log inside a loop, resulting in N database round-trips for N subscribers.

```typescript
for (const subscriber of subscribers) {
  try {
    await sendNewsletterDigestEmail({...});
    
    // Individual database write per subscriber
    await prisma.emailLog.create({
      data: { subscriberId: subscriber.id, ... }
    });
    
    domainEmailsSent++;
  } catch (error) {
    // Another individual database write on error
    await prisma.emailLog.create({
      data: { subscriberId: subscriber.id, status: 'failed', ... }
    });
  }
}
```

**Problems:**
1. N database round-trips for N subscribers (N+1 pattern)
2. Poor performance with large subscriber lists
3. Increased database connection overhead
4. Slower execution time for cron job

**Recommended Fix:**
Batch email logs and use `prisma.emailLog.createMany()` to insert all logs in a single database operation.

**Estimated Impact:** High performance improvement for large subscriber lists (10x+ faster for 1000+ subscribers)

### 3. Inefficient Category Extraction in Sitemap Generation
**File:** `src/app/sitemap.ts`  
**Lines:** 115-139  
**Severity:** High  
**Impact:** Performance, Memory

**Issue:**
The sitemap generator fetches ALL companies with their categories just to extract unique category names, loading unnecessary data into memory.

```typescript
const categoriesResult = await prisma.company.findMany({
  where: {
    content: { some: { domainId: currentDomain.id, isVisible: true } },
    categories: { isEmpty: false },
  },
  select: { categories: true }, // Still loads all category arrays
});

const uniqueCategories = new Set<string>();
categoriesResult.forEach((company) => {
  company.categories.forEach((category: string) => {
    if (category && category.trim()) {
      uniqueCategories.add(category);
    }
  });
});
```

**Problems:**
1. Loads all companies into memory just to extract categories
2. Inefficient for domains with thousands of companies
3. Could use database aggregation instead
4. Same pattern repeated in `src/lib/sitemap-generator.ts` (lines 201-214)

**Recommended Fix:**
Use Prisma's raw query or aggregation to get distinct categories directly from the database, or cache the category list.

**Estimated Impact:** High memory reduction, Medium performance improvement

---

### 4. Sequential Review Stats Calculation After Updates
**File:** `src/app/api/admin/reviews/route.ts`  
**Lines:** 154-172 (PATCH) and 227-244 (DELETE)  
**Severity:** High  
**Impact:** Performance

**Issue:**
After updating or deleting a review, the code fetches ALL reviews for the company to recalculate statistics, even though only one review changed.

```typescript
// After updating a single review
const activeReviews = await prisma.review.findMany({
  where: {
    companyId: review.companyId,
    isApproved: true,
    isActive: true,
  },
});

const avgRating = activeReviews.length > 0
  ? activeReviews.reduce((sum, r) => sum + r.rating, 0) / activeReviews.length
  : null;
```

**Problems:**
1. Fetches all reviews when only aggregate data is needed
2. Inefficient for companies with many reviews
3. Could use Prisma's aggregate functions
4. Pattern repeated in DELETE handler

**Recommended Fix:**
Use `prisma.review.aggregate()` to calculate average and count in a single efficient query.

**Estimated Impact:** High performance improvement for companies with many reviews

---

### 5. Inefficient String Hashing in Color Generation
**File:** `src/lib/utils.ts`  
**Lines:** 109-116  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Impact:** Performance

**Issue:**
The `getColorFromString` function uses an inefficient loop to calculate a hash for color generation.

```typescript
export function getColorFromString(str: string): string {
  let hash = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    hash = str.charCodeAt(i) + ((hash << 5) - hash);
  }
  const color = Math.floor(Math.abs((Math.sin(hash) * 16777215) % 1) * 16777215));
  return '#' + color.toString(16).padStart(6, '0');
}
```

**Problems:**
1. Manual loop for string hashing is slower than built-in methods
2. Called frequently for UI color generation
3. Could use more efficient hashing algorithm
4. Complex mathematical operations for simple color generation

**Recommended Fix:**
Use a simpler, more efficient color generation algorithm or memoize results for frequently used strings.

**Estimated Impact:** Low-Medium performance improvement for UI rendering

## High-Priority Optimization Opportunities

### 6. Missing Database Query Optimization in Search
**File:** `src/app/api/search/advanced/route.ts`  
**Lines:** 159-182  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Impact:** Performance

**Issue:**
Distance calculation is performed in JavaScript after fetching all results, rather than using database spatial queries.

```typescript
let companiesWithDistance = companies.map((company) => {
  let distance: number | null = null;
  if (lat !== 0 && lng !== 0 && company.latitude && company.longitude) {
    // Haversine formula in JavaScript
    const R = 6371;
    const dLat = ((company.latitude - lat) * Math.PI) / 180;
    // ... complex calculation
    distance = R * c;
  }
  return { ...company, distance };
});
```

**Recommended Fix:**
Use PostgreSQL's PostGIS extension or built-in spatial functions for distance calculations at the database level.

**Estimated Impact:** Medium performance improvement for location-based searches

---

### 7. Inefficient Category Aggregation Pattern
**File:** `src/lib/db-queries.ts`  
**Lines:** 115-136  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Impact:** Performance, Scalability

**Issue:**
The `getCategories()` function fetches ALL companies to extract unique categories, even though it's cached.

```typescript
export async function getCategories() {
  return cacheWrapper(
    CacheKeys.categories(),
    async () => {
      const companies = await prisma.company.findMany({
        select: { categories: true },
      });
      
      const categoriesSet = new Set<string>();
      companies.forEach((company) => {
        company.categories?.forEach((cat) => categoriesSet.add(cat));
      });
      
      return Array.from(categoriesSet).sort().map((name) => ({
        name,
        slug: name.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, '-'),
      }));
    },
    { ttl: 3600 }
  );
}
```

**Recommended Fix:**
Use a database-level DISTINCT query or maintain a separate categories table for better performance.

**Estimated Impact:** Medium performance improvement, especially for initial cache population

---

### 8. Synchronous Email Sending in Loop
**File:** `src/app/api/cron/newsletter-digest/route.ts`  
**Lines:** 206-266  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Impact:** Performance, Scalability

**Issue:**
Emails are sent sequentially with a 100ms delay between each, making the process very slow for large subscriber lists.

```typescript
for (const subscriber of subscribers) {
  await sendNewsletterDigestEmail({...});
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100)); // Sequential delay
}
```

**Recommended Fix:**
Implement batch email sending with a proper queue system (e.g., Bull, BullMQ) for better throughput and reliability.

**Estimated Impact:** High performance improvement for newsletter delivery (10x+ faster)

---

## Medium-Priority Improvements

### 9. Repeated Domain Lookup in Sitemap
**File:** `src/app/sitemap.ts` and `src/lib/sitemap-generator.ts`  
**Severity:** Low  
**Impact:** Code Quality

**Issue:**
Domain lookup logic is duplicated across multiple sitemap-related files.

**Recommended Fix:**
Centralize domain resolution logic in a shared utility function.

---

### 10. Inefficient Array Operations in Data Processing
**File:** `src/lib/ai/data-processing.ts`  
**Lines:** 332-348  
**Severity:** Low  
**Impact:** Performance

**Issue:**
Batch processing uses sequential Promise.all calls with delays, which could be optimized.

**Recommended Fix:**
Use a proper batch processing library or implement concurrent batch processing with rate limiting.

---

### 11. Missing Index Opportunities
**File:** `prisma/schema.prisma`  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Impact:** Query Performance

**Issue:**
Some frequently queried fields lack composite indexes that could improve query performance.

**Recommended Fix:**
Add composite indexes for common query patterns (e.g., `[companyId, isApproved, isActive]` on Review model).

---

### 12. Redundant Data Fetching in Analytics
**File:** `src/app/api/companies/[id]/analytics/route.ts`  
**Lines:** 66-77  
**Severity:** Low  
**Impact:** Performance

**Issue:**
Analytics data is fetched without pagination, potentially loading large datasets.

**Recommended Fix:**
Implement pagination or aggregation for analytics data to reduce memory usage.
