## Design System

### Colors & Status Badges
- **Active**: Green (#10b981)
- **Trial**: Blue (#3b82f6)
- **Canceled**: Red (#ef4444)
- **Past Due**: Yellow (#f59e0b)
- **Expired**: Gray (#6b7280)

### Responsive Breakpoints
- Mobile: < 640px
- Tablet: 640px - 1024px
- Desktop: > 1024px

### Key UI Patterns
- Card-based layouts
- Tab navigation
- Modal dialogs
- Status badges
- Progress indicators
- Icon usage (lucide-react)
- Smooth transitions

## Localization

All content fully localized in French (Français):
- Page titles and descriptions
- Button labels
- Status messages
- Error messages
- Helper text
- Email templates

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: All endpoints require authenticated user via NextAuth
2. **Authorization**: Users can only manage their own companies
3. **API Validation**: Input validation on all endpoints
4. **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without exposing internals
5. **Rate Limiting**: Protected by Stripe and backend rate limiting

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests
- Component rendering
- Data fetching
- Error handling
- State management

### Integration Tests
- Full subscription purchase flow
- Company selector functionality
- Filter operations on admin dashboard
- Email template generation

### E2E Tests

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Data Fetching**:
   - Efficient Prisma queries with proper selections
   - Indexed database queries by subscription status

2. **Component Optimization**:
   - Memoization of components where appropriate
   - Lazy loading of modals and dialogs

3. **Caching**:
   - Browser caching for pricing data
   - Session management for user data

## Future Enhancements

1. **Phase 3.3**:
   - Payment history and invoice management
   - Billing address management
   - Tax calculation and VAT handling

2. **Phase 3.4**:
   - Usage analytics per subscription tier

   - Family/team accounts

3. **Phase 4**:
   - Advanced dashboard with charts
   - Subscription analytics
   - Custom pricing per domain
   - Volume discounts

## Migration Guide

### Database
- No new database changes needed for UI

### Environment Variables
- No new environment variables required
- Utilizes existing Stripe keys

### Deployment
1. Push code to repository
2. Vercel automatically deploys
3. No database migrations needed
4. Stripe webhook already configured from Phase 3.1
