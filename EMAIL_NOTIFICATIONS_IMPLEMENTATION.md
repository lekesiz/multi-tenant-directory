**Implementation Date:** 16 October 2025  
**Implemented by:** Claude AI  
**Feature:** Email notifications for reviews

---

## üìã Overview

Email notifications have been implemented for two key review-related events:
1. **New Review Notification** - Business owners receive emails when their business gets a new review
2. **Review Reply Notification** - Reviewers receive emails when business owners reply to their reviews

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Details

### 1. New Review Notifications

**File Updated:** `/src/app/api/reviews/submit/route.ts`

**Key Changes:**
- Import `sendNewReviewEmail` from email service
- Fetch business owners with email preferences when loading company
- Send emails to all verified business owners who have opted in for new review notifications
- Non-blocking email sending (errors don't affect review submission)

**Email Recipients:**
- All verified business owners of the company
- Only those who have `emailNewReview = true` preference

**Email Contents:**
- Business name
- Reviewer name
- Star rating (visual stars)
- Review comment (if provided)
- Direct link to business dashboard reviews
- Unsubscribe link

### 2. Review Reply Notifications

**File Updated:** `/src/app/api/business/reviews/[reviewId]/reply/route.ts`

**Key Changes:**
- Import `sendReviewReplyEmail` from email service
- Include company data when fetching review
- Send email to reviewer if `authorEmail` is available
- Non-blocking email sending

**Email Recipients:**
- The original reviewer (if email was provided)

**Email Contents:**
- Business name
- Reply content
- Link to view the review on the public company page
- Professional formatting

## üîß Configuration

### Email Service Configuration

The email system uses Resend as the email provider. Required environment variables:

```bash
# Email Service
RESEND_API_KEY="your-resend-api-key"
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL="noreply@yourdomain.com"
RESEND_REPLY_TO_EMAIL="support@yourdomain.com"
```

### Email Preferences

Business owners can control their email preferences through their profile settings:

- `emailNewReview` - Receive notifications for new reviews
- `emailReviewReply` - Receive notifications when someone replies to their review
- `emailWeeklyDigest` - Weekly summary (not implemented)
- `emailMarketing` - Marketing emails (not implemented)

## üìä Email Templates Used

### New Review Email Template
- **Subject:** ‚≠ê Nouvel avis {rating} √©toiles pour {businessName}
- **Color Scheme:** Yellow/amber (#FCD34D) header
- **Key Elements:** Star rating visualization, review content, reply CTA

### Review Reply Email Template
- **Subject:** {businessName} a r√©pondu √† votre avis
- **Color Scheme:** Green (#10B981) header
- **Key Elements:** Reply content, link to view on site

## üöÄ Usage Flow

### New Review Flow
1. Customer submits review via `/companies/{slug}` page
2. Review created in database (pending approval)
3. System fetches all business owners with `emailNewReview = true`
4. Emails sent asynchronously to each owner
5. Owners can click link to view and reply

### Review Reply Flow
1. Business owner replies via dashboard
2. Reply saved to database
3. If reviewer provided email, notification sent
4. Reviewer can click link to see the reply

## ‚ö° Performance Considerations

- **Asynchronous Sending:** Emails are sent without blocking the main request
- **Error Handling:** Email failures don't affect core functionality
- **Batch Processing:** Multiple emails sent in parallel using Promise.all
- **No Retry Logic:** Failed emails are logged but not retried (future enhancement)

## üîí Security & Privacy

- **Opt-in System:** Business owners must explicitly enable email notifications
- **Unsubscribe Links:** All marketing emails include unsubscribe tokens
- **Email Validation:** Reviewer emails are validated before storage
- **No Email Exposure:** Emails are never exposed in public APIs

## üìà Future Enhancements

1. **Email Queue System:** Implement robust queue with retry logic
2. **Email Analytics:** Track open rates and click-through rates
3. **Template Customization:** Allow business owners to customize email templates
4. **Digest Emails:** Weekly summary of all reviews and metrics
5. **Multi-language Support:** Translate emails based on recipient preference

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Emails Not Sending**
   - Verify RESEND_API_KEY is set correctly
   - Check Resend dashboard for API errors
   - Ensure email addresses are valid

2. **Missing Emails**
   - Check business owner email preferences
   - Verify reviewer provided email address
   - Check spam folders

3. **Wrong URLs in Emails**
   - Ensure NEXTAUTH_URL environment variable is set correctly
   - Must include protocol (https://)

### Debug Logging

Enable debug logging for email operations:
```typescript
console.error('Failed to send review notification email:', error);
```
